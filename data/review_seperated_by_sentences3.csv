Dear Potential Buyers,0
before you buy I would like you to know a few facts about this product,0
The color is cream - close to ivory,0
"it is not white, in fact it is far from white",0
If you have a high performance job,0
"a waiter,  a barman or you spend some  hours in office wearing the  suit",0
", than you will feel like wearing a plastic bag - wet and uncomfortable with strong sensation of aching",2
The information,0
on website and on shirt's  label indicates that it is 100% cotton,0
It is not,2
"It is 100% polyester, uncomfortable to use",2
"This shirt,  20-30 minutes after ironing, will lose it shape, and you will look like a rickshaw  driver after very long rainy day",2
"The price for 100% polyester shirts is usually 70% cheaper  than cotton, because difficult to wear in cold or hot days",2
"From the ethical point, looks like ""Amazon"" is taking very  strange business direction, by selling polyester as a cotton",2
"It is not ""Essential"" it is ""Strategic Mistake""",2
I returned the item,2
Not acceptable,2
I purchased a 16??32-33??French Blue shirt,0
"Very much liked the color, the fabric, the fit when I first tried it on",1
It washed up nicely,1
I liked it so much that I anticipated buying two to three more,1
"So, what?ôs the problem?  Well, when I put it on and with my hands at my side everything is great, however if I move my arms or do almost anything, the sleeves become 1-3 inches too short and I must return my hands to my sides and pull the sleeves back down",2
It seems like the shirt is just too small across the back,2
I'm really happy I decided to order one of these shirts,1
"I was looking to buy a red/blue tattersall and when I saw this, I figured it was worth a shot",1
"I typically wear Brooks Brothers non-iron shirts, and while these aren't the same quality, they are definitely comparable to brands such as Calvin Klein",1
"For the money, it is a fantastic value and I would have given it 5 stars had it not run pretty small",1
"This is marketed as a 'regular fit', and while I am certainly a large guy",0
6'3 250,0
", I expect a regular fit shirt to be relatively loose fitting given the measurements I buy",0
17,0
"5, 35",0
"This will not fit you if you are, sorry, very overweight or obese",0
"I am going to order a 18"" neck next time and see how it fits",0
I bought this dress shirt from Amazon Basics and another dress shirt of the same size / color Kirkland brand from Costco as a test for which $20 men's long sleeve dress shirt is better,0
Costco wins,2
Comfortably,0
The Amazon Basics shirt looks thinner and cheaper,1
It's fabric is a bit stiffer and less comfortable,2
"Either the sleeves are a bit shorter for the listed size, or the shirt shrank -- neither of those options is good",2
"Lint and fuzz cling to the Amazon shirt more, even though I washed it and the Costco shirt at the same time",2
"Overall, it's not an awful shirt, but if you've got access to a Costco, the choice for a $20 men's dress shirt is easy, and it's not Amazon Basics",2
These dress shirts are great,1
"They are a nice white, fit well and awesome price",1
Can?ôt beat 20 bucks for a dress shirt anywhere else,1
"I first got this size shirt in the slim fit but was a little too tight for me, wanted more maneuverability of my arms",2
some people might like that tight though,1
So returned it no problem and got the regular fit and couldn?ôt be happier,1
Absolutely love it,1
Must buy,1
Oh and it really is non-iron,1
Comes out of wash great,1
This shirt surpassed my expectations for this price point,1
I have been ordering another brand from Amazon and the quality of the Amazon Essentials shirt is so much better and the fit is better,1
"For all my dress shirts, this is going to be the shirt I buy",1
"When I lose a little weight, I will be buying Amazon Essential pants also",1
Everything I have bought from Amazon Essentials so far has been excellent quality at an affordable price,1
I'm hooked,1
I bought this for my husband after I ran one of his white shirts in a colored wash and it came out gray,0
He put this on as soon as I have it to him and really loves it,1
I did notice that it is a bit see-through,2
But he doesn't mind that his undershirt shows through,1
This is a very well constructed shirt for the average size man,1
"highly recommend, ",1
but if you are a BIG size man then this is not the shirt for you,2
It is way to small in the stomach,2
The sleeves and neck size are fantastic,1
Fantastic price,1
This is the first time I have been disappointed by Amazon Essentials and I have bought several other items - which were all good,2
The fabric used for this shirt is just not right,2
The label says cotton but I have my doubts,2
Too shiny and doesn't feel right,2
"Super grabbed lint, etc",2
Reminds me of a gangster shirt,2
Someone at Amazon Essentials dropped the ball,2
I will never wear this shirt,2
"Sorry, Amazon, but this is bad",2
"Way undersized, bought a Van Heusen shirt with this one, exact same neck and sleeve measurements",2
"The Van Huesen shirt fit fine, this one I could not even button",2
I give it one star as the fabric was bright and colorfull,2
"I got the Van Heusn, a Steve Land, and 2 AMazon shirts",0
"Steve Land was 10$ more than others Van Husen was 23, Amazon was $20",0
Steve Land was the best as the black was a real black,0
Fit was great and so was the fabric 100% cotton,0
"THIN, but I wear a black undershirt",0
Still thin,0
Amazon Essential 2nd best,1
"NOT the Solid Poplin, this was wrongly sized",2
", as it is almost a black indigo",2
"You cant tell unless you hold it up with a actual black shirt or if you are matching black pants, it can be a issue in day time",2
"Also it is 100% cotton, fit is a bit snug on chest , BUT it may get worse with washing",2
"I also purchased a 2nd Amazon shirt which fit great and the fabric was not see through, and it was more a casual threading as it has a micro wrinkle look vs a candle wax like dress shirt look",1
"This is a great shirt also, yet suffers the dye ink of the indigo black, and not a true black",2
Still I am keeping these and returning the VanHusen,1
"I was never a fan of them, and now I know why a few discerning others felt the same",2
:-,0
"This shirt is the Wrinkle resistant, regular fit, and besides the size measures it shows a L/XL/XXL indication",0
"The ""Poplin essential"" does not show that and the midsection stomach area runs rather tight for a 37"" sleeve with 18""neck",2
The midsection was a tight 46,0
"I love the quality of this shirt, the fitting, and the price",1
This shirt outshines the $60,1
0,0
men's warehouse,0
shirts I usually buy in terms of all of the above,0
"Not to knock my other shirts, because I still love them as well but I am definitely buying these from now on",1
"I am 5'7"" and 180#, a little on the chunky side",0
I used to lift weights so my chest,0
I dont know the size,0
"is a little bigger, not in the way I would like-so a nice, good looking fit is sometimes difficult to achieve, but this shirt manages to make me feel comfortable and make me look nice and fitted",1
This review is based on wearing the shirt once all day,0
I ordered an 18 1/2 neck 34-35 sleeve length,0
I am 6 feet 250 LBS,0
I am pleasantly surprised that the shirt fit perfectly and irons easily,1
It did not feel like I was wearing a piece of linen--it did not become wrinkly even after wearing it all day,1
The fabric kept it's shape all day like the comparable premium store bought brand,1
Note that this shirt is a classic fit with the traditional fabric,1
not the stretch-flex kind,1
"I cannot vouch for it's durability over time but for the price, I will come back to buy another",1
These were a replacement because I couldn't find the shirt I purchased prior,0
It appears Amazon replaced a prior shirt with this version,0
In any case I bought these for my boyfriend and the material is definitely a lower quality,2
Not nearly as soft and the neck chafes him so badly that he can't wear these shirts,2
you'll also want to be sure not to wash it with anything else because it picks up everything else in the washer and dryer,2
It's a shame really because the shirt itself fits perfectly fine,1
Disappointed and searching again,2
I just got this a few days ago and washed it,0
It fits well,1
The only issue I have is that the collar stays can come out in the washing machine/dryer and get lost,2
"over the past years, I have only bought shirts that have collar stays sewn in so they don?ôt get lost",0
"I basically drilled two small holes in the stays and sewed them into the collar, and they now stay in",0
"At this price, And otherwise good quality, I am happy to buy more and see the collar stays in the other shirts also",1
I was looking for a full cut shirt that could be worn untucked,0
I ordered 15,0
5X32-33,0
These shirts are very nice but the cut is too snug for me,2
"Also, the sleeves were definitely 32 and not 33",2
"I'm 5'10"" and weigh 170",0
I ordered this shirt and it ripped in the area pictured after a few wears,2
There was no excessive use or wear at that point in my opinion so I submitted a return,0
Amazon graciously offered me a new shirt,1
"I was supposed to return the other one, and didn?ôt so I ended up being charged for both",0
That?ôs fine because it was my fault for not returning the shirt,0
But now the second shirt has also ripped in a similar fashion,2
the one pictured,0
Just a heads up that these shirts appear to have a flaw,2
"Brand new, the cut seems as nice as high quality",1
"brands, and the fabric seems to be higher quality,",1
also,0
I bought two of these shirts because I needed the 16 1/2 neck size,0
I really like how easy it is to button the neck button because I had a mild stroke five years ago that affected my left hand a bit,1
The fit is perfect and the quality is first class,1
"Being retired I don't wear a dress shirt that often, but when I do  I don't want to have to fight to get dressed",1
Buy this shirt,1
You won't be disappointed,1
Have been buying Amazon essentials white shirts for a while,0
Recently started noticing that the shirt buttons are cracking or cracked,2
Also noticing that the quality of the shirts does not stand up to dry cleaners,2
Don't know how many shirts I have offhand but I am going to stop buying for a while,2
Too bad,2
"With regard to material, these amazon 100% cotton shirts are not as high-quality as ""designer"" 100% cotton shirts like you could buy in department stores",2
"The problem is it's hard to find 100% cotton shirts in the department stores these days, at least out my way",0
"The shirt fits well--not that ""slim fit"" for guys that eat one lettuce leaf a day",1
"For the price, it's a very good shirt",1
"Shirt looks fantastic, and the collar is great for collar stays",1
Very good looking shirt and I am very pleased with it,1
Can use either casual or fully dressed up with a suit and tie,1
These shirts fit great and look very sharp,1
My only complaint is that the collars fabric is very rough,2
Wearing this shirt all day is impossible for me since it makes my neck feel raw,2
I solved this by buying a piece of disposable stick on fabric that serves as a collar protector,2
It?ôs the only way I can wear these shirts comfortably,2
Needed a white shirt for my husband to wear to our sons wedding,0
He has several expensive shirts that didn?ôt fit at the neck,0
He was uncooperative in going to the store to buy one so I tried Amazon because of the quick shipping,0
Great fit,1
Looked great and no one knew it was inexpensive,1
Thanks,1
You get what you pay for with this shirt,1
"The fabric is very thin and the sleeves are too short, particularly when you bend your arms",2
"I was disappointed as I really like the Amazon polo t-shirts for warmer months, but I won't be buying any more of these",2
I normally where a 17??but ordered a 17 1/2,0
Collee was great but chest and waste was tight,2
Suppose to be regular fit ???,0
Sizing okay,1
Style? Not so much,2
Picture makes it seem like small squares pattern,0
reality is fairly large ?úplaid??- highly unflattering unless you?ôre a bean pole,0
So these shirts are supposed to be 100% cotton,0
The material is beyond stiff that it actually left scratch marks in my biceps,2
Fits fine but definitely not breathable nor comforrable to wear,2
This shirt is really nice,1
I wasn?ôt sure at first when I purchased it because it was an Amazon branded shirt but it?ôs one of my favorites,1
I have to wear a dress shirt to work everyday and hate to spend a lot of money on them so the price right on this one so I gave it a chance,0
"It looks great, fits great and comes out of the dryer without wrinkles",1
Great shirt,1
"I was looking for a pink shirt to add to the single pink shirt that I have, and I clicked on a the color that I wanted",0
"However, when the shirt was delivered, the color was not the shade that I ordered",2
it was almost white,2
"I seldom return items, and did not return this shirt",0
I will simply use it as one of my white shirts,0
Lovely satin like fabric,1
Looking forward to buying more shirts from this brand,1
Only wish they were not so wasteful with the packaging,2
There are plastic inserts AND cardboard just to prop up the collar,2
The metal pins are also quite unnecessary,2
A great dress shirt,1
Comfortable and just the right weight,1
Nicely made with no loose threads,1
Fit is pretty much as expected,1
Seems to be holding up after being dry cleaned a few times,1
5 out of 5 stars,1
My only gripe is that I was expecting the stripes to be more subtle and less bold,2
"This is just my personal taste, but I wanted to wear this with a suit and tie, and the stripes seemed too bold for me to do that",2
"Otherwise it fit my 5???? 156lb frame perfectly and it?ôs suitable for casual Fridays, and with dress slacks and no tie",1
I wanted a new white all-cotton shirt,0
"Contrary to some other reviews, my shirt had a front pocket",0
"I am 5'8"" and 130"" and the 15"" x 32""/33"" shirt fit me fine",1
I would have liked for the sleeves to have been,2
"5"" longer but that is not a major issue",2
My only caution is that the shirt has not been washed yet so I cannot say anything about shrinkage,0
I love this shirt,1
"It is nicely breathable, fits like it should, and the collar keeps its form",1
Iron it with a little spray starch and it looks like it came from dry cleaners,1
"I have lots of higher end, more expensive shirts, but this one is in my weekly rotation during the summer",1
"33""-34"" is the normal length of long sleeves that I wear",0
"The first shirt I ordered with 32""-33"" sleeve length, but they were too short",2
"Fortunately, the shirt fit my son perfectly",1
"Since I really liked the shirt, I reordered 34""-35"" sleeve length and it fits me well",1
The shirt fits great and looks good out of the dryer,1
Unfortunately even after ironing it looks like it has static cling,2
I like that the Amazon essential regular fit shirts can be ordered by neck and sleeve size,1
The Amazon shirt fit at the waist is not baggy  and tucks in nice,1
Unfortunately I will not be purchasing again due to the unprofessional look of the shirt even after ironing,2
*Purchased for my husband to wear weekly with church pants,0
and suit,0
"This shirt works great as a basic, button down, dress shirt for men",1
The only thing that we don?ôt love about it is the fact that the sleeves can?ôt take cuff links,2
But it works nicely for church every week,1
"These shirts, made in Vietnam, are labeled ""Regular Fit",0
""" IME, they are not",2
"They seem to be more ""slim fit",2
""" I bought several on account of the price",0
Returned them all,2
"After all that, I will say they are made of good material and nicely sewn",1
I was hoping for a shirt that fit like a Brooks Brothers Regent fit 16,0
5 or 17 by 37,0
This is definitely tighter and too short to be a 37 sleeve length,2
I don't love the fabric,2
The sleeves are tight on my arms,2
"I'm 6'4"" 235, not huge arms",0
The neck was to tight ,2
but the rest of the shirt fit him perfectly,1
He looked so handsome,1
Neck was good,1
"Chest too small could not button, but I am a chesty female",2
"I shop mens because the fabric is thicker, warmer and overall it is higher quality than what is found in women's department",1
Length of sleeves was good,1
I will look for a larger size,0
"A great-looking, great-performing white shirt",1
Wrinkle free and not too see-through or anything like that,1
Fit as expected,1
This shirt is really a great value for the money,1
Thanks,1
This product was much too small for a regular fit 17 34/35,2
It was almost 2 inches from closing around my chest and stomach,2
"I'm 6'3"" 250 lbs and this size in other manufacturers fits just fine",0
Amazon should stay out of the manufacturing business and just ship products,2
"If you want a good shirt for about $20, these are great",1
I now have 3 different colors and very happy with them,1
"I am sure there are others with smoother fabric, but not for this price",1
Highly recommend them,1
"Nice, regular white shirt",1
Disappointed just a little that I had to get such a large neck size to get the right body fit,2
"I am assuming that the shirt fits well, because my brother is kinda picky",1
He asked for them because he liked wearing the same manufacturer and style in the past,1
Shirt was not as described,2
Amazon description was white shirt with blue stripes,2
Delivered shirt was white shirt with LARGE BROWN and blue stripes,2
Online picture also only showed narrow blue stripes,2
Very disappointing,2
I ordered a black one because my son needed to wear black shirt for his orchestra concerts,0
Unfortunately the shirt looks more dark navy than black amongst other players wearing black,2
Too late to return,0
"If you need real black shirt, do not order this",2
I love the fit on this shirt and the quality is great for the $,1
"I am 6' 2"" and 180 lbs",0
so I bought 3 of the slim fit as I normally fit in them better but the Amazon regular fit is actually pretty slim and a better fit for me,1
My husband is very muscular but short so finding him shirts is a struggle,0
5?? 17 1/2 neck,0
these shirts are affordable AND fit great,1
Nice material,1
We?ôre buying them in all the colors,0
Amazing for the price,1
Even without the great price a solid build of a shirt,1
I just got the shirt so my review is based on one try- on and no day to day wearing,0
The shirt looks to be well made,1
The material appears to be of good quality and is classy looking,1
I gave it four star because I have not had a chance to wear it for an extended time,0
Tight fit in the arms and chest,2
This is such a comfortable and professional work shirt,1
"The only complaint was that it was a little tighter on the shoulder/upper chest, but not bad",2
"If you are bulkier in this area and prefer the shirt slightly loose, then get a size bigger to avoid the ""slim fit",0
""" Would definitely order more of these",1
This brand is my sons go to,1
"It is well-made, is offered with longer arm which is always a problem for the man in my family",1
"Excellent cut, excellent fabric and as a seamstress, this is very important to me",1
fits well although I tried the slim fit which I usually have and that was tight,0
This fits just right,1
good quality and great value for money,1
Received the item crumpled in a plastic bag not the original packaging,2
I'm a professional,0
I like to use new shirts right out of the package,2
Impossible with this,2
It needs to go to the dry cleaners to be pressed,2
Now I have to wait for a refund before I can replace the shirt,2
This has never happened before,2
I'm quite disappointing,2
I washed and dried the shirt after trying them on to make certain they fit,0
"Initially, they fit great, but the shirts shrunk about 2 sizes after washing and drying and no longer fit at all",2
My Van Heusen shirt did not shrink,0
I would not recommend the Amazon Essentials shirts at all,2
I plan to return them and buy more Van Heusen shirts,2
I've worn a 16 1/2 x 34 dress shirt for over 20 years but this shirt did not fit me,2
"Also, the fabric is very thin for a dress shirt",2
"Accordingly, I returned it to Amazon and received a refund",0
a little tight at the waist,2
I really love the Amazon Essentials line,1
"For everyday casual clothing, you can't beat them",1
I own 3 shirts like these and they look great after 3 months of washing and wearing,1
I recommend looking at the polo,0
golf,0
shirts too,0
"This is a beautiful shirt, really looks good with all colors of sweaters",1
Nice fall and winter look,1
Thank you,1
I?ôm never buying another type of dress shirt,2
This is thin and cool so I?ôm looking forward to the summer with this shirt,2
This shirt fits like the general sizes as a regular fit,0
This is the dress shirt for the professionals,0
I?ôm 5????and about 200 lbs,0
I got a 17??and 34/35 sleeve length and it fits great,1
This seemed like more of a slim fit shirt,0
The cheat was tighter and so were the sleeves,2
Plus the pocket was placed a little to high on the shirt,2
I returned them,2
Surprisingly nice and good fitting shirt,1
Hard to believe that it's 100% cotton,1
Much Much nicer than any 100% cotton wash and wear shirt that I've ever owned,1
This I have been wearing to work,0
looks good,1
Fit as expected and I have had no issues,1
Held up over a couple of washes too,1
I like the price for the item and it fit me true to size,1
"This shirt was very tight around the chest and midsection, unlike every other shirt this size that I own/wear",2
Cannot comfortably wear it,2
Disappointing because it looked to be a nicely made shirt for a very reasonable price,2
It wasn't washed or dried - no shrinkage,0
Just runs small/tight,2
Huge value,1
"These shirts are constructed well, fit as expected, and don't cost a ton",1
Makes you wonder how companies can sell their shirts at $100+ when these are available,1
The sleeves and collar fit very nicely,1
However the body is more like a slim fit cut and that?ôs a problem when you?ôre a bigger guy like myself,2
When with a sweater it looks great and can leave a button undone if needed,1
Real decent shirt for the money,1
Good fit for a big guy,1
"Big as in fat, not athletic",2
"I have been wearing this on Zoom calls for 7 months now, hasn't needed ironing or washing yet",1
I normally wear a 17 1/2 and I am a 2 xl so like a 50 chest,0
I ordered a 18 /36 and the neck is way big and the body is made for a basketball player not a former Defensive lineman,2
I can button it but it is ridiculous,2
The good thing is its 20,1
00 and a nice fabric and weight,1
"Everything about the shirt is very good, the quality of fabric is fine, I would think you needed more thread count but then the price may go up",1
Product made in China,0
For some reason fit somewhat small,2
I have other shirts made in Bangladesh and they are a much better fit for the same size,2
"Fabric is not the softest, but I'd pick this shirt over the competitors who offer shirts at 3x the price",1
I would give it 4 stars if amazon created an amazon essentials dress shirt with a button down collar,0
"Note as mentioned in a couple of reviews, the shirt is a little tight in the way it is made",2
I ordered a 16,0
my normal size,0
and it just fits,1
My recommendation is order one half neck size up from your normal size,0
a 17 instead of 16,0
"Other than that, it is a very nice shirt",1
Very comfortable yet durable dress shirt,1
Have ordered many times,1
Good value,1
Surprisingly good quality shirt for the money,1
It ironed nicely out of the dryer and looks like any other more expensive shirt,1
Shirt came wrapped like I bought it at a suit store,1
Material felt like high quality,1
No odor,1
Ready to go out of the bag and not flimsy at all,1
Nice button down dress shirts,1
Two buttons on sleeves for comfort,0
Highly recommend this seller &amp,1
product,0
Fantastic Classic cut and construction-moderately priced,1
I love it,1
Great for everyday to the office use,1
"The material is good, the cut is very nice, the size is true",1
wonderful style and texture,1
"It just didn't fit me at 6'2"" and 230lbs",2
"Product for arm length and neck size fits accordingly, but the shirt doesn't match typical dimensions further down the chest and is extremely tight",2
"The shirt is marked as cotton, but it sure looks like polyester",2
"Whatever the fabric is, it is very thin, and transparent",2
If you don't wear an undershirt your body will show right through the fabric,2
"With an undershirt, the undershirt will show",2
"This short was bought before by someone that decide not to keep it, it came completely unfolded inside a plastic bag with nothing written",2
"this is an Amazon Essential product, can?ôt believe your quality control dis not catch it",2
worst packaging experience in more than 10 years with Amazon,2
It was a steal for what I paid for it,1
Very good quality and looks great,1
"Good quality overall, fits well, comfortable",1
Might just be a little below a name brand shirt but I am happy,1
The shirt came with a dirty package and a black smudge on the white shirt,2
"Further, the material was cheap and rough",2
"This 15 1/2 32-33 is not a regular fit although the label says ""Regular""",2
More importantly I normally find 32-33 length a bit long,0
"These sleeves are way to short, like 30-31",2
The neck is not too accurate either,2
Chinese garments come in  batches and this batch is mismarked,2
And I mean compared to other men's large sizes,0
"Seems well made, used for a play, and wearable, just not as comfortable",2
"Sleeves are longer than I expected but otherwise the shirt looks great, doesn?ôt wrinkle much and is a great value",1
Disappointed with the size,2
Every other company is true to fit,0
This one doesn?ôt close,2
Very upsetting,2
Love these shirts,1
Highest quality and fit of any other brand of white shirts I have purchased,1
"Preparing to order more but, alas, they have been discontinued",1
I took a chance on it and love it,1
The quality of the material is comparable to that of the Kenneth Cole shirts that I previously purchased,1
I really liked this shirt which was decently priced,1
$20 ,0
", although I have enjoyed other economy-priced shirts of comparable quality for less",0
My only suggestion is that it could be $2 less per shirt to be really competitive,0
This is a high quality shirt at less than half the price you would find in the stores,1
I highly recommend it,1
must write a rave review because guys gain weight in their gut not butt-thank you for a shirt that looks good on a big guy,1
Comfortable dress shirt for work,1
Irons easily,1
"Similar quality to local retailers, but much less expensive",1
I don't often wear dress shirts so this was perfect for me,1
After drying it needed to be ironed but since I won't be wearing it very much it was OK,1
Less expensive that other shirts,1
product fits great for my physique and texure very good for good price,1
keep up the good job amazon and their vendors as i feel,1
I love these shirts,1
For the price this shirt can not be beat,1
"Nice fit, and the collar looks great",1
Just make sure you buy some nice collar stays,0
Great shirt,1

Like it actually had been ironed,1
Will purchase again,1
I had to return the shirt because the shirt is made of a super thin material in which an undershirt can be visible,2
This shirt is not cut out to be used for business purposes,2
My husband loves these and wants no other shirts now,1
Many people complained of the slim fit - for him it was perfect and had no bubble in the back like many lower cost shorts have,1
dress shirt for Church and I should get a free shirt or a refund with a 1/2 larger in the neck size and see how that works,2

These shirts are great dress shirts at a very fair price,1
This shirt fit way too tight,2
Had to send back,2
A little tight otherwise surprisingly nice shirt,1

Very satisfied,1
The cloth is low quality and thin,2

Great shirt,1
Excellent shirt,1
The color was pale pink and perfect for a beach Valentine's Day wedding,1

"Great fit, great price, fashionable",1
This was a shirt for my work,1
It was great and I may buy more,1
The label on the shirt indicated 16,0

Value for money,1
Great shirt,1
Excellent Quality fits good,1
All white event,0
Fit poor,2
This review is for the white version,0
"It's a very nicely made shirt, and all of the seams are impeccable with a very small number of uncut threads in places",1
"I find it to be true to size, with one caveat regarding the sleeves",1
"The sleeve length is perfect with my arms down, but the sleeves ride up more than those on my other dress shirts when I raise my arms",0
"These have removable collar stays, which is my preference",1
The one thing that I like the least,1
"and the reason for four stars instead of five, even at this price",0
is that the fabric is more transparent than my other shirts,2
"At least with the white color, you'll see skin or an undershirt through it",2
"It's not horrible, mind you, but I prefer a more opaque fabric",2
"All in all, a nice shirt and a good value at the",1
current,1
$20 price point,1
"This is a beautiful, pure white shirt",1
"When I get a new white shirt, I do not usually take it out of its wrap that it comes in, because white shirts begin to age immediately, they begin to turn yellowish or dull",0
"That is why men who must wear suits and ties to work must have a constant new supply of white shirts with long sleeves, in order to look their best,  The men get to the point when they can spot an older white shirt on a colleague, and then they start to think less of this colleague",0
"You can solve this by occasionally wearing a blue shirt or a yellow shirt, if it matches your suit and socks, but best practice is to wear a gleamingly new white shirt",0
"It must have long sleeves, as it is unprofessional to show your arms bare, even on the hottest days",0
This goes for women too - a businesswoman should not show bare arms,1
Or too much neck,0
It is unprofessional,0
"As for hemlines, below the knee is best",1
"I am an expert on dressing for the corporation, after having worked in the corporate world most of my life",0
"Anyway, back to this shirt",0
"As I said, I opened it and tried it on, and the sleeves are a bit too long",2
Too long is better than too short,0
"Too long can be solved with a pair of good, old-fashioned sleeve garters that are white so that they don't stand out",0
Sleeve garters can be found at haberdashery shops or sometimes in the men's department of a good department store,0
"So, you should have sleeve garters on hand",0
The size of a shirt is determined by the neck size,0
"Unfortunately, I have always had a sensitive neck, so I must get a shirt with a neck size of 17 at least",0
This way I won't be pulling at my neck all day long,0
The top button must always be fastened or you will look slovenly,0
"Also, your tie must be tied properly - a double Windsor knot is best",0
Please do not use a clip-on tie or a bow tie,0
"Once in a while, a bow tie is acceptable - maybe once or twice a year, and it must be 100% silk - in fact, all ties must be 100% silk and you are judged by your tie's design and color",0
I have at least 150 ties,0
I do not wear striped ties,0
"I prefer ties with abstract designs, paisleys, and other different designs, and ties must look fresh and unwrinkled",0
The color of a tie is important,0
"I tend toward blues, purples, and lavenders, with intricate patterns",0
"Once in a while I'll wear one of my favorites - a water-colored street scene in Paris, or a dark blue tie with light blue colored turtles that I bought in Switzerland - but do not wear favorites over and over",0
I have a black tie with red polka dots on it that I wear when I don't feel good,0
"When you have many ties, you can just grab one in a hurry and wear it and it'll be fine",0
"Again, back to the shirt",0
"If you can see your skin through the shirt, you must wear a well-fitting white undershirt with short sleeves",0
"You don't want to show your nipples or an extremely hirsuit body, or any scars",0
I have had heart surgery so I always wear an undershirt,0
"To wrap this up, this is a good and useful shirt, but you must adhere to what I have said if you wish to appear well dressed",1

"- Sleeve cuff is single button, 2 position",0
We got the purple tattersall and I have to say it's much better looking in person,0
The squares are a lot cleaner looking and not as small as they seem online,1
"The up-close listing pic shows it better, I think",0
"It is somewhat non-wrinkly, if I hang it right out of the dryer",1
"That's useful, since we're casual sorts",1
He says it's comfortable to wear as far as fit,0
"No binding, it moves nicely",1
"I do feel like it will wash softer over time, which will make it perfect",1
"But 4 stars for now, sorry",0
"Thanks for not using pins, though",1

Amazon brands are increasing their scope of affordable products especially in their clothing lines and this shirt is a great example,1
The colors and pattern is conservative  enough to be warn in a business setting but is equally at home at a relaxed casual outing,1
Equally at home under a suit or paired with blue jeans or khakis,1
Construction and cut share details of shirts costing twice the price,1
The collar stays for example are removable and can be replaced with new plastic ones or metal inserts if you have them,0
The sleeves have dual buttons to accommodate your wrist size or watch  and the  sleeve placket also has a button,0
Extra buttons are sewn inside the bottom of the front packet to replace any that might come off over time,0
Stitching is clean and straight,1
"There's a single front breast pocket and the alignment of the fabric pattern matches perfectly the underlying shirt pattern, which is critical in plaid shirt especially",1
Price is very affordable especially if you compare it to any designer label,1
"Money was saved on the shirt fabric as it is a lightweight cotton and suitable, but it isn't a more substantial weave and cotton you would expect to find on a fine shirt",0
So while entirely suitable and attractive it will not replace a high end shirt if that's what you're expecting,0
"I received the 32/33 inch sleeve and 16"" neck which I should not have ordered knowing my arms are extra long, and as expected, if I stretch my arms out straight, the sleeves are just not long enough",2
The cut leans more toward an athletic cut so works best with a slimmer torso,0
"All told, a very good value for the price",1
Attractive and versatile,1
A small deduction for the lower end weight and lack of heft of the fabric,0
"My husband seems to wear a popular size when it comes to dress shirts, so finding them in the local stores can be tough-so I often order online",0
For the most part-men's fitted shirts like this,0
sized collar and sleeve length,0
"seem to fit pretty universally, but for some reason I found this a bit big when he tried it on",2
Granted many companies now make a 'regular' fit and slim fit,0
"This is a regular cut, but still seems a bit big in the chest area",2
"However, a good white shirt is always needed-and because this one seems to run a bit big, my husband can wear it with our without a tie-with for work, without for a more casual, business look",0
"The shirt is well made-buttons sewn on properly, cuffs stitched nicely and the collar lies flat",1
"The material is soft without being too sheer, but has enough rigidity to not look sloppy",1
And the price point makes this a steal,1
"less than $25 for a well made, men's dress shirt?  Yes please",1
"Overall, I like this shirt -- it fits pretty well, it's attractive, and it's well-made",1
Fabric is strong without being rough or stiff,1
Seams are clean and strong,1
The plaid pattern is muted and attractive,1
Fits in with what all the other guys at my office job are wearing,1
My one complaint is that the arms/shoulders are a bit snug,2
"I've cultivated a bit of a belly over the years, and this fits well through the midsection, but it's just a touch tight through the shoulders, and it's snug enough on the arms that flexing my bicep makes me feel like the Hulkamaniac",2
"On the other hand, it's a dress shirt",0
"It doesn't give enough freedom of movement for the secret service, but if you're like me and you spend 8 hours sitting in front of a computer, it's not going to be a problem",0
"This is a quality dress shirt and a bargain at the price -- take that, designers",1
"I have deducted one star because arm movement is slightly restricted -- if you raise your arms, the shirt body lifts up as well",2
A little more give under the arms would be welcome,2
"Otherwise, though, the shirt has everything I like -- a chest pocket, spread collar with slots for stays, two spare buttons attached to the hem, a good long hem, etc",1
The finish seems topnotch -- no loose threads -- and the fabric is 100% cotton for breathability,1
The colors are subdued in this purple tattersall version -- they appear to be a muted purple and gray,0
"All in all, then, this is a great shirt for the money, and the movement issue probably won't matter to workers sitting at desks",1
It is hard to believe that this shirt can be offered at its price point,1
What an incredible value for $20,1
I usually wear a medium or 15 and 1/2 inch neck and the fit was right on,0
This is a very good quality dress shirt with modern styling,1
"The material is thin, which I like as it permits an undershirt and takes an iron well",1
Thicker shirt material tends to be more difficult to iron,0
"Cant speak about longevity, so you may want to bump up in quality if you plan to wear frequently",0
The design is a bit dull and it would be great if they had some more colorful and progressive patterns,2
"However, for an occasional dress shirt user who is on a budget, I just don't see how you could go wrong",1
And I mean that,0
"The shirt is 100%, all in, designed for the office",1
It's the archetypal dress shirt,0
"While yeah, I guess it *could* be used for casual wear",0
it's not going to look casual,0
It's going to look like you're trying too hard,0
"Everything about the tailoring and materials just says ""wear me with a suit and tie",0
"The shirt itself fits just right to size - sleeve length is appropriate, shirttail length is appropriate, and the material is thin enough to be comfortable under a jacket",1
"In sum, a perfectly suitable, not-fancy-just-classic dress shirt",1
A very good piece,1
"I've had good luck with a lot of Amazon Essential stuff, so I'm really surprised about this shirt",2
"First, it doesn't fit well",2
The belly is too tight and the shoulders are,2
"they manage to be both tight and loose at the same time, don't ask me how",2
"The material is also somewhat stiff and uncomfortable, not at all like some of the others",2
"And lastly, the pattern is much bolder than the picture lead me to believe",2
This is a great basic dress shirt that goes with anything,1
It fits well and came out of the wash without shrinking,1
"It's 100% cotton, so it takes a light steaming or ironing, but doesn't need a lot",1
"I wear dress shirts several times a week, and this is one of my new favorites",1
The double pleats really help with range of shoulder motion,1
I'm adding this shirt in outher colors to my wardrobe ASAP,1
"This is a thinner fabric, but not flimsy or super-sheer",1
"The construction is of good quality, and it looks very polished and classy",1
Great value,1
"You can always pay more for higher quality textiles, but for basic button-down-white-shirt, this is a very economical one that presents well",1
I'm so happy to have this shirt,1
"I have been going to a million weddings, and a decent-quality dress shirt is exactly what I need",1
"The white is a good color, the material is comfortable, and overall, it's an attractive shirt",1
"Honestly, no one would ever know that it's ""Amazon Essentials"" brand",1
I highly recommend this shirt for anyone who tears through dress shirts and simply needs more in their arsenal,1
This is a well made white dress shirt,1
It is a must have for all men's wardrobes,1
"It comes in 6 colors: black, blue, lavender, light blue, pink and white",0
The shirt is long sleeve and is a button up design,0
"The hem is rounded, with a double pleat in back, rounded single button cuffs, a chest pocket and spread collar",0
This shirt can be dressed up or down depending on what you wear with it,0
A very nice look,1
"I am pleased with the fit, quality, and feel of this shirt",1
PROS:,1
Excellent fit,1
100% cotton and keeps the body cool,1
Great looks,1
Machine washable,1
CONS:,2
Small imperfections like extra string hanging off some buttons,2
The fit of this shirt rivals that of Banana Republic or J,1
Penny,1
"Give it a shot, you may like it",1
"I've worn a size 18 shirt for many years, and sometimes they're a little small, it all varies by manufacturer",0
But this was ridiculously too small,2
"Wherever these are made, someone needs to give them an accurate sizing guide",2
This shirt is very stylish and fits perfectly for my size,1
The sizing is comparable and matches exactly with what I would expect compared to other shirts I have in this size,1
"I have gotten quite a few compliments from people at work when I wear this shirt, so that is a tremendous positive",1
I would definitely be interested in purchasing other shirt designs of this product,1
The shirt that was mailed to me is not the shirt in the main picture,2
Please be advised that this shirt has one basic pocket on the left and not two as shown in the picture,2
I am disappointed and think that this discrepancy should be addressed by Amazon,2
Beautiful shirt,1
Excellent quality,1
Fit my boyfriend perfectly,1
I ordered a large,0
The actual shirt is so much nicer than the online pictures,1
Colors are a little more vivid than what the pictures show,2
My boyfriend loved this shirt,1
This is a fairly good dress shirt,1
It is thin so it looks best if you wear an undershirt under it,0
It is basically an wrinkle free shirt,0
It has good stitching and is a good fit,1
The regular fit seems to run only slightly larger than some of our other dress shirts,0
"However, overall it?ôs a good shirt",1
We machine wash and line dry,0
This is a gorgeous shirt,1
"It is very well made, fits well and washes beautifully",1
"The fabric has very fine lines of purple and blue for a very subtle, mostly white, plaid",1
The shirt comes out of the dryer ready to wear,1
"It is not slim fit, but regular fit",0
"Next time my hubby needs a dress shirt, we will definitely order another",1
"This shirt is a nice, basic white dress shirt",1
The fabric is a little thin,2
"I don't normally like wearing an undershirt but with this one, I would recommend it",2
The rest is fine,1
"The fit, for me, is fine",1
"It is a little slim, but I also gained a little weight",0
It washes well and irons nicely,1
Fits as expected and the design is classic dress shirt,1
Crisp white color and the stitching is high quality,1
I also like the material very much too,1
It feels good yet holds its shape well even with no or very minimal starch and it is not too thin i,1
not see through at all,1
Pinpoint weave,1
Thi s white cotton dress shirt is ideal for the office,1
It isnicely constructed and true to size,1
I like the double pleat int eh bck and the rounded hem,1
The fabric is light and a bit transparent,2
Undershirts are visible underneath,0
It launders nicely and is a nice quality business essential,1
"This is more of a basic dress shirt, was hoping for a more modern/smooth fit",2
"The collar feels like it's on the larger side for the size, and the arms where the connect feel like they are a bit restricting, not a great fit, ends up being a bit boxy",2
The fabric pattern is subtle but nice,1
Fits well and looks great,1
"It's a bit stiff, and even after some dry-cleaning there isn't much give",2
The material and the cut are similar to more expensive brands from major department stores,1
No way anyone would guess this is an Amazon Essentials brand shirt,1
"I will be ordering more as they are great for office, church or going out",1
The neck fits me perfectly,1
The sleeves are too long,2
The length of the shirt tails is ideal,1
The diameter of the chest is too large,2
"A shame, as the check pattern is perfect, the construction is sound, and the buttons are neatly and tightly sewn on",1
"Nice quality construction, with good attention to finish details",1
"The fabric is attractive, and the spread collar works well with or without a tie",1
"It is amply cut across the belly, so if you prefer a trim or athletic fit, this is not for you",0
Very nice and crisp dress shirt,1
The tattersall plaid pattern is subtle,1
"However, I think the shirt fits a size too small, or maybe I am a size too big?",2
"Anyway , it has a really nice feel, 100% cotton",1
"An 18"" neck and a 36""37"" arm shouldn't have a chest/waist size for a 120 lb man",2
"These shirts were off the chart small, except in the neck and arm length",2
This could have been a Arrow shirt in the 1960s,0
Old school / classic mens' dress shirt,0
"Medium weight fabric, traditional cut and decent fabric",1
Should be good for many wearings,1
This is a well-made shirt,1
"subtle, tattersall pattern with purple lines, appropriately labeled ""essential""",1
Certainly versatile and comfortable,1
Can be worn with slacks or jeans,1
Good price too,1
This runs a bit big as often happens with Amazon shirts,2
It's a nice dress shirt in a comfortable fabric,1
The collar does not button down,2
"The fabric is bit thin, slightly see-through",2
A classic fit that?ôs not billow-y,2
What a concept,0
This fits great,1
Amazon clothing is on par with most mall/department store/big box retail in terms of quality,1
Great value,1
A white button down shirt is a staple in the wardrobe of many men,1
This fits the bill,1
It fits as expected and looks as pictured,1
Solid shirt,1
I have not had good luck finding a really nice dress shirt online,0
"Usually the fabric is too thin, the cut is too narrow, etc",0
This fits the bill perfectly,1
This shirt is a great fit for my husband,1
true to size,1
"He says it is comfortable and easy care, wrinkle-free",1
We've washed it a few times and it looks great,1
"Good price conscience shirt for my slender, tall sons",1
"It's a little thin in the fabric, but is fine with an undershirt",0
"Comfortable fabric, well-made",1
The pattern is nice and the colors subdued,1
Will wash easily and seems durable overall,1
Very nice quality for the price,1
Great work shirt,1
"The  34/35 is about one inch longer, really a 35/36 and more on the 36"" length",2
"Otherwise a great looking shirt, especially for the price",1
Fit perfectly and made with quality material,1
These shirts are the best dress shirts for work,1
I bought 10 of them,1
They don?ôt cost that much so you can buy plenty and not worry about throwing one away if you stained it,1
Very nice quality dress shirt,1
Goes with Levi?ôs and or slacks and fits very nice with a vest and tie,1
Perfect fit after measuring,1
The shirt did not leave much room and I had to order a size larger than normal and it still did,0
This is a great shirt for the price,1
Needed them for funeral,0
color was what we needed,1
Like,1
For me,1
Stuff is really nice but the color is too light,0
I love being able to get a shirt with a choice of sleeve length as I have short arms,0
I'm a 17,0
"5 "" neck and only 5'9"" tall so usually end up with shirts tailored for a gorilla",0
These shirts fit,1
Are well made summer weight shirts,0
I usually pay twice the price at M&amp,0
"S, and the sleeves never fit",0
I have all 4 choices for this reason and wish they did more,0
Very good quality shirt,1
little on the large side but very comfortable,1
One problem however is that the sleeves are really long and I have fairly long arms,2
Great when rolled up but I will need arm braces to wear under a suit,2
Paul,0
Really good fit,1
Fits round my stomach nicely which not all shirts do,1
Arms fit well and are of a generous fit,1
Nice finish hopefully will wear well,1
I am long in the body so 37??sleeve gives you a much longer shirt to fit in the waist,0
Great fit and great material and very smart collar,1
"Very happy , i have the set ie 4 shirts",1
Recommend,1
I have lots of coloured shorts but this allowed a sensible price short in white wrinkle free well easier to iron,1
Fits well and feels comfy,1
Nice looking well made shirt,1
Washes well and dries fairly crease free,1
I hate ironing,0
Few minutes in tumble dryer on decrease setting and it?ôs ready to wear again,1
Very Good Quality and Very Good Presentation,1
I feel very well with it,1
I will buy some more,1
Love this shirt very nice quality and a good fit looked very smart sadly it was ordered for a funeral,1
The sleeves on this shirt were really short and the fit on the body was boxy,2
Not sure who this would actually fit,2
The shirt looks very good,1
It is to be sent as a present so can't say how it fits yet,0
Great value for money,1
Great fit,1
Washes well,1
Looks very nice on too,1
Good shirt but the delivery service was terrible,2
Bought for my dad,0
They're his favourite shirts,1
good material good value great thank you,1
Good fit round my larger body,1
Feels like good quality but not worn yet as using short sleeves,1
"OMG, what a brilliant quality/ fit shirt for knocking around in",1
You could easily wear it with a suit and tie if you don?ôt mind a single cuff,1
Well made,1
Smaller than a 4x should be,2
Tight round chest,2
My other 4x fits fine,0
Beautiful blue shirt ?ëå,1
Greatly value for money and a perfect fit,1
Quality,1
Excellent fit,1
And goes with my suit,1
Smooth and comfy,1
Haven?ôt wished it yet so don?ôt know post wash condition,0
I'm not sure what others are complaining about regarding the sizing,0
"It fits my fat belly perfectly well, and I received exactly what i was expecting",1
Neck size 18,0
5 matches up very well with other shirts I have of that size,1
More than enough room in the body,1
This is not slim-fit at all,1
"Material seems a little flimsy, but not too bad",0
Certainly nothing to complain about for the price,1
We'll see how well and long it lasts,0
"Any better than 6 months and I'd say it's worth the money, though I'd rather spend more for something that will last longer",0
Only complaint is that there are little plastic bits in the collar to keep it pointed,2
"My collar only had one of these in place, as the little pocket for them is left open on one end",2
Must have fallen out somewhere along the way,2
These shirts are a really good deal,1
"They fit as expected, though they're a little long",0
"Shouldn't pose a problem, though",0
"Material is nice, will probably work well in the warmer weather",1
"It looks sharp, will do very nicely for the office",1
Wish there was some way to be notified when the other colours I want in my size come back in stock,0
This product appears and feels on the cheap side,1
"But for $26 it is not bad, I just expected more",2
"If Amazon Essentials were to come out with a premium line, that likely would be better",0
"Would I purchase again, no",2
I have not tried other AE clothing products and not sure I would further,2
My wrinkle free non iron shirt arrived rolled up in a ball in a very small bag,2
see photo,0
Terrible packaging by amazon had to pay $5 for dry cleaning to get all the wrinkles out,2
So much for wrinkle free,2
Very nice shirt,1
"Given its low price, I was expecting only a reasonably made product, but the quality of the shirt actually exceeds my expectation",1
The colour of the real thing is darker than the picture and looks better in real thing,2
this is the regular size that I take but the body on these shirts was a little bit narrower than all my others,2
"Also, it was not as wrinkle free as I had hoped and collar absorbs neck skin oil very quickly",2
I AM USED TO BUYING SHIRTS BY LARGE XLARGE OR XXLARGE - FOUND IT VERY HARD TO BUY BY NECK SIZE TO HAD TO RETURN AS IT TURNED OUT TO ONLY A SMALL SIZE,2
Love it,1
I like that fact that I can choose a shorter sleeve,1
I wear medium size shirt from local store,0
Usually the sleeves are too long,0
"Very good shirt for the price, sleeve is a bit too long but other than that don?ôt hesitate",1
Very excellent well priced shirt,1
Doesn't shrink,1
Perfect size,1
Nice clean business casual shirt,1
Collar doesn't curl up after wash,1
So  I will repeat purchases,1
Cotton is decent but not great by any means,0
At the price point that this shirt sells at I give it a pass though,1
Es una camisa 100% algod√≥n de muy buena calidad,1
Great shirt winklefree after wash,1
Tailored well with stiffness around neck and wrists as expected,1
fabric is very thin and translucent [see through],2
Not a problem for me as I keep my coat on when visiting clients,0
Great,1
Too small,2
Perfect and have done 2 washes,1
has kept up,1
I feel the sleeves are about a inch short,2
A+,1
A little tight in the chest given the neck and sleeve size,2
Good price,1
Overall a nice shirt,1
Fits as expected and washes wrinkle free,1
Wife is happy,1
"Consegna perfetta, camicia elegante, buon cotone",1
Parfait selon monchoixo,1
"Fit is perfect, material is perfect",1
"Good quality, perfect fit, great price",1
I am very happy with this purchase,1
This is one of the best clothing items I've ordered on Amazon,1
Nice shirt and material however it was too small,0
Good value for the price,1
nice shirt,1
Passt wie erwartet,1
Two shirts ordered fit well,1
Two did not fit at all,2
"Semble de bonne qualit√©, col avec baleines ce qui n'est plus courant",1
Taille bien,1
A voir la tenue dans le temps apr√®s lavages,0
"N√©anmoins le ""Guide des tailles"" Amazon n'est pas claire",2
i like that there was no pins and packing,1
Good value,1
Great value,1
Fit perfectly,1
Ok,1
"Fit well, good quality",1
It is good,1
