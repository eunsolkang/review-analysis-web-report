## Service Description
### Service background
The size of the e-commerce market has grown gradually since the past. Especially this trend accelerated during the Covid-19 Era. It has been estimated that the e-commerce market grew by 13.4 trillion won in 2019, and 14 trillion won in 2020. As the consumers were heading to the online platform, businesses also tilted their vision toward the online market. ‘Offline to Online’ movement took place among major retail corporations, and new businesses opened up by adopting D2C(Direct to Consumer) and subscription service as their business model. 
While direct communication was the way for acquiring the opinion and feedback of the consumers in the past, now businesses had to find a new way for gathering insights on the online platform. What triggered the interest of the businesses were the reviews consumers left online. Reviews are the main communication line between consumers and businesses, and reviews are considered significant because consumers leave direct feedback or indirectly reflect their opinion on their reviews. From the perspective of the businesses, discovering insights from these reviews was the key point to success. 

### Pain point 
There is no doubt that analyzing the reviews is an essential part of CRM(Customer Relationship Management). Despite the significance, companies are actually failing to make the most of their reviews. Simple clustering of review data and superficial collection of industry trends are not sufficient enough for gaining substantial insights and constructing strategies which will guide the business to success. What is more problematic is that small businesses and startups lack the infrastructure and know-how to even initiate any action. 


### How to solve?
That is why we strongly believe that a sophisticated review analysis service would be required in this specific period of time and even to the post Covid-19 Era. trop.er, what we name the service as, will analyze our client’s reviews, and based on this information trop.er will derive business insights that will not only improve one’s CRM efforts, but also contribute to enhancing the overall business model. 

### Solution
The "trop.er" provides web report services that analyzes review data and visualizes it in various styles : positive/negative demonstration, keyword cloud, keyword clustering. On top of this main service, trop.er displays overall trend of a specific industry not only in a domestic scale but even to an international scale. Furthermore, through trop.er’s consulting matching service, our clients are able to improve and re-build their business model. 

### Expected Effects
Through the insights derived from the review data analysis, businesses can respond to their consumers in an appropriate manner that will contribute to their business image. A quick and precise response to the consumers’ feedbacks not only attract new consumers to the brand but also coverts normal consumers to loyal ones, thus adding to the company’s efforts for expanding the business. However, trop.er does not stop there. Provided trend reports will enable the firms to catch up with the ever-changing trend in the e-commerce market and keep up with the overall consumer need. Cooperation with consultant expertise will help businesses to diagnose their current situation in a critical manner, and provide guidelines that contribute to one’s business model revision.
